# One known bug

The Ai sucessfully detects my voice/questions and optional text inputs on both Civic car screen and PC Desktop, but fails to move her mouth on the Civic car screen.

She moves her mouth according to IBM Assistant's lipsync tech on [Desktop LQ Unity version]() successfully.

This Civic lack of mouth movement could be either due to the Civic's low 512 mb ram limit or lack of compatibility with the Civic for IBM Ai Assistant.


# xSynth run instructions on Civic 10th gen
 

1.	Ensure you have Android version 4 eg, 4.2.2 in your Honda Civic/Car display console.
2.	Turn on your Wifi on your Civic/Car display.
3.	Root/hack your Honda Civic display, using Honda Hack. (25 usd) Allows installation of custom apps, like my xSynth app, or File Manager, or Youtube to your Civic, and other cool things like putting your reverse camera on while moving forward. (This can be done directly from your car, from the “search” icon in app list, by visiting autohack.org. You can buy the 25 usd key on desktop first, on the same site, then use the site in car to root your car’s display)
4.	In your car/Civic, after you rooted it, install Play Store, and login into your google account, or create one if desired.
5.	In your car/Civic, after you rooted it, install a File Manager, (I suggest File Manager+). (This should be fine, as I find that my civic had about 2gb memory free internal, and more than 6 gb on sd card. Sadly ram is low around 512 mb, but my ai runs quickly regardless)
6.	Download my xSynth app (apk file) and put it on a flash drive.
