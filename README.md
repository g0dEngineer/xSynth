# World's 1st 3d automobile Ai friend and assistant for Honda Civic 10th generation

# One known bug

The Ai sucessfully detects my voice/questions and optional text inputs on both Civic car screen and PC Desktop, but fails to move her mouth on the Civic car screen.

She moves her mouth according to IBM Assistant's lipsync tech on [Desktop LQ Unity version]() successfully.

This Civic lack of mouth movement could be either due to the Civic's low 512 mb ram limit or lack of compatibility with the Civic for IBM Ai Assistant.
